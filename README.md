# ds2500-final-get-data-starter
Starter code for reading the Immigration Enforcement Actions data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics Yearbooks.

The data was too large to share on the GitHub, but good news is that it was very easy to download!

# How to get the data:
1. visit https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2022. These are Immigration Enforcement Actions statistics for each year.
   
2. For yearbooks 2000 - 2022, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. There will be listed zip files for download. Find "Immigration Enforcement Actions 2022 Data Tables". (I will use the year 2022 as an example).
   
3. Create a new folder on your PC (I called mine Immigration Enforcement Actions). Download the the Immigration Enforcement Actions Data tables for each year into your folder and unzip them. Make sure you know the directory for this folder (Mine is "/Users/ekaterinasivokon/Desktop/ds_final_project/Immigration Enforcement Actions"). You will need it to use my code.

4. When finished downloading, paste your directory into my code (DIRECTORY variable). Now you can use my code!

# A few words
This is just some starter code that I created sitting in an airport ^^ It is unfinished and is intended to give you all a brief look into my ideas for extracting data for our project not mind the formatting.
